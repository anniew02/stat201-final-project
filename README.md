# Exploring Potential Relationships between User Ratings and Critic Ratings Between Different Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) Ratings  
For the STAT 201 (Statistical Inference for Data Science) term project, we aimed to answer the following research question:  

> Between different ESRB ratings, how differently do critics and users rate video games? 


We sampled from a dataset called The Video Games Sales 2019, which was generated by a scrape from VGChartz. From this dataset, we analyzed the difference between User Score and Critic Score over the four ESRB Ratings (E - Everyone, E10 - Everyone (10+), T - Teen (13+), and M - Mature (17+)). We also performed one-sample t-tests over a 95% confidence interval at a 5% significance level. We compared the results from simulationg bootstrapping and asymptotics as seen below.

## Overview

**Null hypothesis:**  $H_{0}$ : $\mu_{u} - \mu_{c} = 0$  
There is no difference between the differences of user score and critic score. 

**Alternative hypothesis:**  $H_{1}$ : $\mu_{u} - \mu_{c} \neq 0$  
There may be a difference between the differences of user score and critic score.

> Since the p-values are less than $\alpha = 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis in favour for the alternative hypothesis at a 5% significance level.
